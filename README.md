# Kaggle Competition - Predict Podcast Listening Time

I participated in the **"Predict Podcast Listening Time"** competition on Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/playground-series-s5e4), which aimed to predict the podcast listening time using data from various podcast episodes.

## Score and Ranking:
- **Public score:** 53.21


## Strategy:
- I used **XGBoost** for the podcast listening time prediction.
- Performed **Cross-validation** and **Hyperparameter Tuning** to improve the modelâ€™s performance.
- Explored the data and created new features to enhance prediction accuracy.

## Objective:
The goal of my participation was to explore and enhance my skills in **Machine Learning** and to solve real-world problems using data.
